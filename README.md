# std_new: a personal standard setup for new Rust projects

By Jonathan A. McCormick, Jr. 

This repository contains a personal standard setup for new Rust projects. It includes commonly used configurations, dependencies, and project structure that I prefer to use when starting a new Rust project.

## Features
- Enforces safe coding practices by forbidding unsafe code.
- Utilizes popular crates like `serde` for serialization and deserialization, and `static_assertions` for compile-time assertions on auto-traits.
- Provides a basic example struct with commonly derived traits.
- List of common commands for building, testing, and formatting the project. See [commands.md](commands.md) for more details.

## Getting Started
To use this setup for your new Rust project, simply clone this repository and modify it according to your project's requirements, or browse through the code and cherry-pick the parts you find useful.

## License
This project is released into the public domain. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.
