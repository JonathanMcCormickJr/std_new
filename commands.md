This file documents the most common commands used in my Rust projects. 

```sh
# Create a new Rust binary project
cargo new my_project --bin

# Create a new Rust library project
cargo new my_project --lib

# Build the project in debug mode
cargo build

# Build the project in release mode
cargo build --release

# Run tests
